- User-friendly mobile app providing tailor-made advice on money management and financial planning for underprivileged rice farmers in Thailand, effectively tackling one of the key roots behind their struggles.
 
- Not only encourages a good habit of financial record keeping, but also analyzes whether amount of spending and income sources are sustainable. If not, it offers advice on how to reduce expenditure or increase income, accordingly to each farmer’s individual circumstance.
 
- Provides related useful web links, next to advice, to additional sources of knowledge and information or organizations which could be at their help (e.g. Department of Water Resources, Ministry of Agriculture, related NGOs and university departments).
 
- Helps the user calculate the farming costs as well as the projected revenue for a planned future farming investment; this is then used to determine whether this investment is worthwhile. If not, the app also provides advice/alternative ideas on how to improve feasibility. 
 
- Algorithms used to provide advice are based on both quantitative data, collected via primary and secondary researches and analyzed using mathematical methods, and expert/best-practice opinions from interviews with farmer community leaders, NGOs, government agencies and academics.
 
- Aims to develop the users’ logical thinking skills, ultimately educating them into becoming rational decision makers. This is done through explaining, step by step, the logic behind each advice given using simple language (since initial primary research has shown that farmers tend to rely on intuition and cultural beliefs, rather than logic, to make financial decisions).
 
- Tested the prototype app, created using proto.io, alongside the data-processing algorithms which were embedded in a spreadsheet, with actual farmers and their families.
 
The final app prototype was well received and successful. All tested farmers said that the app helped point out their unrealized problems and gave realistic advice that they could implement right away, giving them more direction and confidence towards their newfound financial goals. All looked forward to using the app once completed.
